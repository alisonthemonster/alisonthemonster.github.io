I"c<p>I began the Five Things project as a daily handwritten journal. Over time this grew hard to maintain and most of my entries were stored on my computer waiting to be transcribed to my notebook. I built the Five Things website to have an easy way to write entries and to read over your old entries, but I still missed the idea of a physical journal.</p>
