<p>I began the Five Things project as a daily handwritten journal. Over time this grew hard to maintain and most of my entries were stored on my computer waiting to be transcribed to my notebook. I built the Five Things website to have an easy way to write entries and to read over your old entries, but I still missed the idea of a physical journal.</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>I got really carried away with designing the various books and page layouts. I envisioned Five Things supporting a wide range of book options and really pushed myself to come up with lots of ideas and variations. Here are some of my various sketches and designs</p>

<h3 id="generation">Generation</h3>

<p>I researched the best ways to print your own books and the most popular method was through PDFs. So I looked into PDF generating libraries and found a few to try.</p>

<h4 id="pdfjs">PDFJS</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rkusa/pdfjs">PDFJS</a> is a PDF generation library written in Javascript. I used it to create several templates that would parse my JSON data and generate the pages of my book. In total I created eight different templates that could print books in a variety of shapes, column styles, and designs. I used this library when I first began to play around with PDF generation.</p>

<h4 id="jspdf">jsPDF</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF">jsPDF</a> is a client side PDF library with more support and documentation than PDFJS. I recently tried this library out and found it had a lot more flexibility than PDFJS.</p>
