I"C<p>Presently is an open source <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=journal.gratitude.com.gratitudejournal&amp;hl=en">Android app</a> to record daily gratitude entries. It’s been a while since the initial release and I thought I’d post on update on all the new features and things I’ve learned along the way.</p>

<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Search your entries using Room’s FTS
    <ul>
      <li>Room introduced FTS back in late 2018 and it allows you to search through your data by creating a searchable virtual table. <a href="https://medium.com/@sienatime/enabling-sqlite-fts-in-room-2-1-75e17d0f0ff8">This blog</a> was incredibly useful for setting it all up.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Calendar navigation
    <ul>
      <li>Many users had left reviews or reached out to me asking for a way to quickly move to old entries or to add an entry for a day further in the past than yesterday. I had a lot of fun here playing around with animations and working on the motion for opening the calendar.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Themes
    <ul>
      <li>Picking the initial color scheme was such a hard choice that I knew from the start that I wanted to support multiple themes. I had a great time playing around with colors and I expect I’ll be adding new themes in the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
