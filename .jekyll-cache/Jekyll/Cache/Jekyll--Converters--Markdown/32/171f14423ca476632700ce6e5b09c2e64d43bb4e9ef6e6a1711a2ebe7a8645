I"±<p>On March 2nd, 2019 I was lucky enough to get into Women Techmakerâ€™s International Womenâ€™s Day Summit. I had a great time meeting other women in the industry and got the opportunity to try out a Codelab for the Google Assistant. I zoomed through the Codelab and couldnâ€™t wait to get home to try to build one of my own, Google even gave everyone a free Google Home Mini to take home for practice! Thank you! ğŸ™‡â€â™€ï¸</p>
