I"û<p>Presently is an open source <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=journal.gratitude.com.gratitudejournal&amp;hl=en">gratitude journal for Android</a> that I started building about a year ago. We are launching a bunch of new features this month and I wanted to share them here!</p>

<h3 id="new-features">New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Biometric Authentication
    <ul>
      <li>Now users can lock their entries using biometric authentication. This feature is Presentlyâ€™s first opens source contributed feature! Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lalon">Alon</a> who contributed this much requested feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>New themes and theming updates
    <ul>
      <li>I revamped our themes settings view to give a better representation of what applying a theme would look like</li>
      <li>I also added several new themes to the app and I now support colorful icons in themes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Milestones in your timeline
    <ul>
      <li>When a user reaches a significant milestone, like writing five gratitude entries, I show them a congratulations dialog to celebrate their acheivement. Now users can be reminded of their progress by seeing their milestones in their timelines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
