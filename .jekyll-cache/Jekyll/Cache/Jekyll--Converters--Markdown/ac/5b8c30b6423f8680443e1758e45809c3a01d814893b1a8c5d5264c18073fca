I"4<p>I lost my job back in May in an office wide lay off. It was a shock that quickly changed and became the best thing to happen to me in 2019. It gave me 9 months of pure wide open time. I learned Flutter, I worked on Presently and built out a lot of new features, I traveled, I relaxed, I enjoyed a full Seattle summer. It was brilliant.</p>

<p>But this time also allowed me to explore every potential job opportunity I was presented with. I interviewed with over 10 different companies across the country and of all different kinds. I wrote up a detailed report of what the interviews were like <a href="https://proandroiddev.com/android-interviews-in-2019-aa518f321ff">here</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to write a bit more about how I prepared and what helped me succeed.</p>
