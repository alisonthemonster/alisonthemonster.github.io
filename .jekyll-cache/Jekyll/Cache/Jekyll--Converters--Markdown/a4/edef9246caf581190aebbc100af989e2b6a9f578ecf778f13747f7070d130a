I"d<p><strong>Five Things is a daily journaling project</strong> where at the end of every day you write down five things that happened to you. I started this project on January 1st, 2016 with a handwritten daily entry. I was able to find time to write most days but when I was away from my notebook I would jot down my entry on my phone. Over time more and more entries were written in my phone and not in the notebook. That was when I built <a href="https://www.fivethings.me/">FiveThings.me</a>. Since then Iâ€™ve iterated several times on backends, authentications, and designs. Below is the timeline of the project and its current plans:</p>

<a href="https://www.fivethings.me/">FiveThings.me</a> was written in vanilla Javascript, Node, and built with a Firebase backend. It uses Google Sign In and the Firebase Realtime Database. Users can log in, write new entries, and view their old entries. I still use this website every day to write down my Five Things.</p>

After some time of writing digital entries I missed the feeling of a physical journal. I realized that I could take my entries (in JSON format) and generate a PDF that could be printed and turned into a physical book. I started to play around with <a href="https://github.com/rkusa/pdfjs">PDFJS</a>, a PDF generation library, and generated a few different book styles. This was great as I got to experiment with visual design and I spent a lot of time sketching and dreaming up new book designs.</p>

<h3 id="december-2017---february-2018-android-client-phase-1">December 2017 - February 2018: Android Client Phase 1</h3>
<p>I decided to rebuild the Android client this time with Kotlin. It was my first time using Kotlin and I learned a lot here. Again it used the Firebase Realtime Database and Google Sign In. I used the brand new Android Architecture components and followed an MVVM architecture. It had a swipe navigation to move between days and a navigation drawer to access the other views.</p>

<h3 id="april-2018---september-2018-android-client-phase-2-the-new-backend">April 2018 - September 2018: Android Client Phase 2, the new backend</h3>
<p>Inspired by great apps like Daylio, I realized I could measure the sentiment of my entries and chart it over time. I began to work with my good friend, Nagkumar, to build out a new backend that would be able to support sentiment analysis better than the Firebase Realtime Database. This meant rewriting authentication, using Retrofit/Okhttp to make the requests to our own server instead of Firebase, implementing a new search feature, and of course building out the new analytics feature.</p>

<h3 id="september-2018---november-2018-android-client-phase-3-a-visual-redesign">September 2018 - November 2018 Android Client Phase 3: A visual redesign</h3>
<p>Once the new backend was fully implemented I could focus on UX. I designed a series of onboarding illustrations, error states, and focused on animations. At this time I also updated the navigation to a Bottom Navigation Bar with a FAB to open the calendar.</p>

<h3 id="today-and-beyond">Today and beyond</h3>
<p>Work on the Five Things project has stopped for now. I still use the FiveThings.me website every day and plan to for the foreseeable future. There is still work to be done to support sentiment analysis and I have plenty of ideas for book designs to implement.</p>
