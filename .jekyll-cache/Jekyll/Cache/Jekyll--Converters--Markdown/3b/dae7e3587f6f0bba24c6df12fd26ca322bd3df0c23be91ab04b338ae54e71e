I"™<p>The Seattle Vintage Apartment Project is a database of pre-1940s apartments in Seattle. It includes over 300 buildings and has information about their age, architects, and the units inside.</p>

<p>The SVAP started in January 2019 when I began to look for a new apartment. I knew I wanted to live in a vintage apartment and I checked Craigslist every day for new buildings. I started to seriously research the buildings and kept an Excel spreadsheet of my favorites. It quickly outgrew itself and needed a much more permanent and scalable home.</p>

<p>I decided to build an <strong>Android client that would be backed by a Firebase Cloudstore database</strong>. Using the app I could explore existing apartments, add new apartment buildings or units, and search through my database.</p>

<h3 id="how-its-made">How itâ€™s made</h3>

<p>The SVAP is integrated with Google Maps and the Places API to present the map and to allow users to look up addresses and find their coordinates. I used SeatGeekâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/android-PlacesAutocompleteTextView">Places Autocomplete Textview</a> to display the Places API results.</p>

<p>In order to search through the SVAP I integrated the project with Algoliaâ€™s Instant Search product. I index my database using a Firebase Cloud Function (as described in <a href="/blogpost/android/svap/2019/02/09/algolia.html">this post</a>) and then used Algoliaâ€™s <a href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/android/">Instant Search Android SDK</a> to add a search view and search results to my app.</p>

<p>New entries are posted up to the Firebase Cloudstore and any images are hosted in Firebase.</p>

<p>I would love to create a website to allow anyone to view the Seattle Vintage Apartment Project. For now the Android client is the only way to add new data and view the apartments.</p>
