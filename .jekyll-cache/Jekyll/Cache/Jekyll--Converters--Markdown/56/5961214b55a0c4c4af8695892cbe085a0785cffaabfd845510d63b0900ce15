I"˜<p>After living in Capitol Hill for a few years Iâ€™d found a few apartment buildings that were really eye catching. These buildings were built in the 1920â€™s and were built to support the influx of people to the city. I bought the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0786465964/?coliid=I3NXVYGNB3XZY2">Shared Walls</a> by Diana E James and learned a lot about their history and their construction.</p>
