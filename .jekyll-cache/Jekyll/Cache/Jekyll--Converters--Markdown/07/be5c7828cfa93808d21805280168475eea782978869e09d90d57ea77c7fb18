I"S<p>Since going to Google IO back in May I was so excited to try out Flutter. I came back from IO and took <a href="https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart">App Breweryâ€™s Flutter course</a> (excellent course, highly recommend!) and then started to think about what I wanted my very first Flutter app to be.</p>
