I"¬<p>Presently is an open source Android app you can use to write down daily gratitude entries. Users can navigate through a simple timeline view and to add and read entries. It was designed to be very minimal, with no extra bells and whistles. I built this app to fill the void for simple gratitude journaling apps and to try out Room. I also wanted to try my hand at some design, from the app icon to the Play Store assets.</p>
