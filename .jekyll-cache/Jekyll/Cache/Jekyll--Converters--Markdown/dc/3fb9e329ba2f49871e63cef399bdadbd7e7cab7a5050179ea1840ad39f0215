I"W<p>I lost my job back in May in an office wide lay off. It was a shock that quickly changed and became the best thing to happen to me in 2019. It gave me 9 months of pure wide open time. I learned Flutter, I worked on Presently and built out a lot of new features, I traveled, I relaxed, I enjoyed a full Seattle summer. It was brilliant.</p>
