After living in Capitol Hill for a few years I'd found a few apartment buildings that were really eye catching. These buildings were built in the 1920's and were built to support the influx of people to the city. I bought the book [Shared Walls](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0786465964/?coliid=I3NXVYGNB3XZY2) by Diana E James and learned a lot about their history and their construction. 

I became especially fascinated with their intricate doorways. Many of these vintage buildings boasted beautiful terracotta designs and stained glass windows. Wanting to bring their designs to my own home I started creating vectorized versions of my favorite doorways. Here are the results:
