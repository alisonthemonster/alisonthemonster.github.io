I began the Five Things project as a daily handwritten journal. Over time this grew hard to maintain and most of my entries were stored on my computer waiting to be transcribed to my notebook. I built the Five Things website to have an easy way to write entries and to read over your old entries, but I still missed the idea of a physical journal.

### Design
I got really carried away with designing the various books and page layouts. I envisioned Five Things supporting a wide range of book options and really pushed myself to come up with lots of ideas and variations. Here are some of my various sketches and designs

#### Cover Ideas

### Generation

I researched the best ways to print your own books and the most popular method was through PDFs. So I looked into PDF generating libraries and found a few to try. 


#### PDFJS
[PDFJS](https://github.com/rkusa/pdfjs) is a PDF generation library written in Javascript. I used it to create several templates that would parse my JSON data and generate the pages of my book. In total I created eight different templates that could print books in a variety of shapes, column styles, and designs. I used this library when I first began to play around with PDF generation.

#### jsPDF
[jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) is a client side PDF library with more support and documentation than PDFJS. I recently tried this library out and found it had a lot more flexibility than PDFJS.
