### The Seattle Vintage Apartment Project is a database of pre-1940s apartments in Seattle. It includes over 300 buildings and has information about their age, architects, and the units inside.

The SVAP started in January 2019 when I began to look for a new apartment. I knew I wanted to live in a vintage apartment and I checked Craigslist every day for new buildings. I started to seriously research the builidngs and kept an Excel spreadsheet of my favorites. It quickly outgrew itself and needed a much more permanent and scalable home.

I decided to build an **Android client that would be backed by a Firebase Cloudstore database**. Using the app I could explore existing apartments, add new apartment buildings or units, and search through my database.


### How it's made

The SVAP is integrated with Google Maps and the Places API to present the map and to allow users to look up addresses and find their coordinates. I used SeatGeek's [Places Autocomplete Textview](https://github.com/seatgeek/android-PlacesAutocompleteTextView) to display the Places API results.

In order to search through the SVAP I integrated the project with Algolia's Instant Search product. I index my database using a Firebase Cloud Function (as described in [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2019-02-09-algolia %})) and then used Algolia's [Instant Search Android SDK](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/android/) to add a search view and search results to my app. 

New entries are posted up to the Firebase Cloudstore and any images are hosted in Firebase.

### Future plans
I would love to create a website to allow anyone to view the Seattle Vintage Apartment Project. For now the Android client is the only way to add new data and view the apartments.
